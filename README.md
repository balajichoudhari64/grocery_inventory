The Grocery Inventory Management System is a project that aims to provide a convenient way to manage a grocery inventory. It includes two main components: an API server for handling inventory management operations and a user interface (UI) for visualizing and interacting with the inventory.The project allows users to add grocery items to the inventory and retrieve a list of all items stored in the inventory. The API endpoints handle the logic for adding new items and retrieving existing items, while the UI provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the endpoints.
